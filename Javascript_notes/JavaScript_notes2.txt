# Notes on the second Code School JavaScript course:

#
# While-loops

Basic while-loop, continues to run while boolean expression is true.

Simple example:

``` while(*some expression is true*){
    
        *do this code!*

}```

An infinite loop would have the expression: `while(true){}`

So to print numbers 1 to 5 in ascending order:

```
var number = 1;
while (number <= 5){

      console.log(number)
      number++;
}
```

or another example:

```
var trainNumber = 1;
while (trainNumber <= 8){
      console.log("Train #" +trainNumber + " is running.");
      trainNumber++;
}
```

In practice, though, change "8" to a variable that can be changed.

#
# The For-Loop:

Example:

```
for (*start counter here*; *condition to loop if true*; *do this after iteration*{

* code to run*

}
```

So train example:

```
for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= trainsOperational; trainNumber++){
    console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running.");
}

```

Or printing something in descending order:

```
for(var number = 5; number > 0; number--){
	console.log(number)
}
```

List the non-operational trains (9 -12):

```
var trainsOperational = 8;
var totalTrains = 12;
for(var stoppedTrain = trainsOperational + 1; stoppedTrain <= totalTrains; stoppedTrain++){
	console.log("Train #" + stoppedTrain + " is not running.");
}
```

For reality - use while loop to go through all running, then for loop for rest from 1 more than the end of the running loop.

#
# If, Else statements:

Example to combine train loops:

```
for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= totalTrains; trainNumber++){
    if(*condition is true*){
    	*do this*
    } else {
      	*Otherwise do this*
    }
}
```

So:

```
operationalTrains = 8;
for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= totalTrains; trainNumber++){
    if(trainNumber <= operationalTrains){
    	console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running.");
    } else {
      	console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is not running.");
    }
}
```

#
# If-Else - If statement

```
if(condition1){
  *do code1*
} else if (condition2){
  *do code2*
} else {
  *All other cases: do code3*
}

```
 For a train with a special case (train 10 is the express train):

```
operationalTrains = 8;
for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= totalTrains; trainNumber++){
    if(trainNumber <= operationalTrains){
    	console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running.");
    } else if (trainNumber == 10){
        console.log("Train #10 begins running at noon.");
    } else {
      	console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is not running.");
    }
}
```

Nested conditions:

Pay attention to indentations.

i.e. Big red squares, small blue squares, purple circles:

```
if (shape == square){
   if (size == big){
      "make it red";
   } else {
      "make it blue";
   }
} else {
  "it must be a circle, so make it purple";
}
```

Extra statements - if all trains are running just print single message - or if none, again a single statement.

```
...
if (trainsOperational > 0){
   if (trainsOperations == totalTrains){
      console.log("All trains are running today!");
   } else {
     for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= totalTrains; trainNumber++){
     	 if (trainNumber <= trainsOperations){
     	    console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running today!");
     	 } else if(trainNumber == 10){
            console.log("Train #10 is an express train at noon!");
     	 } else {
           console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is not running today!");
     	 }
      }
   }
} else {
  console.log("There are no trains running today!");
}

```

#
# Complex conditionals:

&& - AND
|| - OR

Examples:

```
> (11 >= 11) && (-7 < 6)
```

So if we wanted a second express train (10 and 12)

```
...
if (trainsOperational > 0){
   if (trainsOperations == totalTrains){
      console.log("All trains are running today!");
   } else {
     for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= totalTrains; trainNumber++){
     	 if (trainNumber <= trainsOperations){
     	    console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running today!");
     	 } else if(trainNumber == 10 || trainNumber == 12){
            console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is an express train at noon!");
     	 } else {
           console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is not running today!");
     	 }
      }
   }
} else {
  console.log("There are no trains running today!");
}
```

What if train 3 only runs on Sunday:

```
...
var dayOfWeek = "Friday"
if (trainsOperational > 0){
   if (trainsOperations == totalTrains && dayOfWeek == "Sunday"){
      console.log("All trains are running today!");
   } else {
     for (var trainNumber = 1; trainNumber <= totalTrains; trainNumber++){
     	 if (trainNumber <= trainsOperations && trainNumber != 3){
     	    console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running today!");
     	 } else if(trainNumber == 10 || trainNumber == 12){
            console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is an express train at noon!");
	 } else if(trainNumber == 3 && dayOfWeek == "Sunday"){
	    console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is running today!");
     	 } else {
           console.log("Train #" + trainNumber + " is not running today!");
     	 }
      }
   }
} else {
  console.log("There are no trains running today!");
}
```
